## 🎯 Why Most AI Summaries Fall Short

Ever tried to get ChatGPT or any LLM to summarize a large PDF? You get a couple pages of generic fluff, no matter if your doc is 5 pages or 50. Why? Because every LLM has a hard limit on how much it can output in one go. So you end up with:

*   Summaries that are always the same length, regardless of the input.
*   Important details, tables, and nuance? Lost. Context? Missing. Depth? Not there.
*   You ask for a deep dive, you get a shallow overview.

If you actually want to *understand* a document, not just get a surface-level blurb, you need something smarter. That's where rePaPer comes in.

## 🚀 Why rePaPer is Different (and Better)

rePaPer isn't just another wrapper around an LLM. It's a multi-agent system that:

*   **🧠 Uses Multiple AI Models**: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and OpenAI (GPT-4.1, o4-mini, and more). Pick your favorite, or let the system choose.
*   **🤖 Orchestrates Like a Pro**: An AI "orchestrator" agent reads your PDF, breaks it into logical sections, and assigns each chunk to a specialized summarizer agent. No more one-size-fits-all summaries.
*   **🌍 Multilingual by Default**: You can give instructions in any language, and rePaPer will adapt. Want your summary in Spanish, French, or another language? Go for it.
*   **📏 Scales With Your Doc**: The summary grows with the document. 5 pages? 5 pages of insight. 50 pages? You get a summary that actually covers the whole thing.
*   **📊 Tables & Data Included**: Important tables are preserved and included in your summary. No more missing data.
*   **🎨 Beautiful PDF Output**: You get a clean, readable PDF that you can actually use, share, or present.
*   **⚡ Real-Time Progress**: See exactly what's happening as your doc is processed. No more staring at a spinner, wondering if it's working.
*   **✨ Effortless UI**: Drag, drop, done. Dark mode, light mode, whatever you want.

## ✨ See a Real Example!

Curious about the kind of in-depth summary rePaPer can produce? We've processed the seminal "Attention Is All You Need" paper (the foundation for Transformers!) and made the output available.

*   **Read the original paper**: [Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017) on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
*   **Check out rePaPer's summary**: Explore the `examples/Attention_Is_All_You_Need` directory to see the detailed PDF summary generated by rePaPer.

This example showcases how rePaPer breaks down complex documents into comprehensive, easy-to-digest insights.

## 🔮 On the Horizon: Future Enhancements

rePaPer is constantly evolving! Here are some exciting features we're currently working on to make it even more powerful:

*   **📜 Crystal-Clear LaTeX Equations**: Soon, rePaPer will intelligently identify and beautifully render LaTeX equations from your source documents directly within the summary, ensuring all mathematical details are perfectly preserved and easy to read.
*   **🖼️ Integrated Figures & Images**: We're enhancing rePaPer to not just understand text, but to also incorporate key figures, charts, and images from your PDFs into the final summary, providing a richer, more complete understanding at a glance.

Stay tuned for these and other improvements designed to make rePaPer the ultimate document understanding tool!

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 🐳 With Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get rePaPer running.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/camilovelezr/rePaPer.git
    cd rePaPer
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    *   **Backend:** Copy the sample environment file and fill in your details:
        ```bash
        cd backend/repaper
        cp .env.sample .env
        # Now edit .env with your API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY) and optionally LOGFIRE_TOKEN
        cd ../.. # Go back to the project root
        ```
    *   **Frontend:** Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend/` directory (`frontend/.env`). Set the API URL:
        ```dotenv
        # Make sure this points to your backend service
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
        ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml` if different). The frontend defaults to port 5173 via Vite, while the backend runs on port 8000.

## 🌍 Environment Variables

Configuration is managed via `.env` files:

*   **`frontend/.env`**: Contains `VITE_API_BASE_URL` pointing to the backend.
*   **`backend/repaper/.env`**: Contains API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and optionally the `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`. Copy from `backend/repaper/.env.sample`.

## 📝 Production Build (Frontend)

To create an optimized frontend build:

1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  The production-ready static files will be located in the `frontend/dist/` directory. Deploy these files to your preferred static hosting provider or serve them via a web server like Nginx.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add some amazing feature'`). Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature`).
6.  Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your code is well-formatted and includes tests where applicable.
