# Definition and Classification of Urticaria

## Definition of Urticaria

Urticaria is a medical condition characterized by the development of:

### Wheals (Hives)
A wheal has three typical features:
1. A sharply circumscribed superficial central swelling of variable size and shape, almost invariably surrounded by reflex erythema
2. An itching or sometimes burning sensation
3. A fleeting nature, with the skin returning to its normal appearance, usually within 30 min to 24 h

### Angioedema
Angioedema is characterized by:
1. A sudden, pronounced erythematous or skin-colored deep swelling in the lower dermis and subcutis or mucous membranes
2. Tingling, burning, tightness, and sometimes pain rather than itch
3. A resolution slower than that of wheals (can take up to 72 h)

## Classification of Urticaria

### Classification Based on Duration
- **Acute Urticaria**: Occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both for 6 weeks or less
- **Chronic Urticaria**: Occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks
  - Can be daily or almost daily
  - Can have an intermittent/recurrent course
  - May recur after months or years of full remission

### Classification Based on Triggers
1. **Spontaneous Urticaria**
   - No definite eliciting factor involved
   - Some patients may experience trigger-induced symptoms, but these are not consistent

2. **Inducible Urticaria**
   - Characterized by definite and subtype-specific triggers
   - Triggers always cause wheals, angioedema, or both when present
   - Specific triggers for each subtype (e.g., cold for cold urticaria)
   - Some rare subtypes require combined triggers

### Chronic Urticaria Subtypes
#### Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)
- Spontaneous appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both for >6 weeks
- Can be due to known or unknown causes

#### Inducible Urticaria
- Symptomatic dermographism
- Cold urticaria
- Delayed pressure urticaria
- Solar urticaria
- Heat urticaria
- Vibratory angioedema
- Cholinergic urticaria
- Contact urticaria
- Aquagenic urticaria

**Note**: Patients can have multiple subtypes of urticaria simultaneously.

## Important Distinctions
- Urticaria must be differentiated from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:
  - Anaphylaxis
  - Autoinflammatory syndromes
  - Urticarial vasculitis
  - Bradykinin-mediated angioedema
