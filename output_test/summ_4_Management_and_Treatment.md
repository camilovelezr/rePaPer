# Management and Treatment

## Treatment Goals

The primary goals of urticaria treatment are:
- Treat the disease until it is gone
- Treat as efficiently and safely as possible
- Aim for a continuous Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) of 0
- Achieve complete control
- Normalize quality of life

## Treatment Approach

The therapeutic approach to chronic urticaria should involve:
1. Search for and, if possible, elimination of underlying causes
2. Avoidance of eliciting factors
3. Tolerance induction
4. Pharmacological treatment to:
   - Prevent mast cell mediator release
   - Reduce effects of mast cell mediators

## Pharmacological Treatment Algorithm

### First-Line Treatment
- Second-generation H1-antihistamines (daily use)
- Standard dose 
- Preferred over first-generation antihistamines
- Examples include: cetirizine, desloratadine, levocetirizine

### Second-Line Treatment
- Updosing of H1-antihistamines (up to 4x standard dose)
- If inadequate control after 1-4 weeks

### Third-Line Treatment
- Omalizumab (add-on to H1-antihistamines)
- 300 mg every 4 weeks
- Can be increased to 600 mg every 2 weeks if insufficient response

### Fourth-Line Treatment
- Ciclosporin 
- 3.5-5 mg/kg per day
- Only for patients unresponsive to previous treatments

## Special Considerations

### Children
- Use same treatment algorithm with caution
- Weight-adjusted dosing
- Careful consideration of age and medication availability

### Pregnant and Lactating Women
- Avoid systemic treatments, especially in first trimester
- Prefer:
  - Loratadine
  - Possible extrapolation to desloratadine and cetirizine
- Omalizumab considered safe during pregnancy
- Individual risk-benefit assessment required

## Additional Treatment Recommendations

- Evaluate treatment necessity every 3-6 months
- Non-pharmacological interventions may help in some cases
- Avoid long-term corticosteroid use
- Short-term corticosteroids may be helpful in acute exacerbations

## Alternative Treatments

While evidence is low, some alternative treatments may be considered:
- Pseudoallergen-free diet
- Leukotriene receptor antagonists
- Immunosuppressives (in specific cases)
- Phototherapy
- Psychological interventions

## Key Principles

- Continuous treatment until symptoms resolve
- Personalized approach
- Regular reassessment
- Minimal side effects
- Improve patient quality of life
