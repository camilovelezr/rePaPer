# Pathophysiology and Burden of Disease in Urticaria

## Mast Cell-Driven Mechanism

Urticaria is fundamentally a mast cell-driven disease characterized by:

- Release of multiple mediators from activated skin mast cells, including:
  - Histamine
  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF)
  - Cytokines

- Complex activation signals that are:
  - Heterogeneous and diverse
  - Include T cell-driven cytokines
  - Involve autoantibodies

- Histological characteristics of wheals:
  - Edema in upper and mid dermis
  - Dilated and increased permeability of postcapillary venules
  - Dilated lymphatic vessels of upper dermis

## Inflammatory Process

The inflammatory response in urticaria involves:

- Mixed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with:
  - T cells
  - Eosinophils
  - Basophils
  - Other inflammatory cells

- Nonlesional skin changes in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU):
  - Upregulation of adhesion molecules
  - Infiltrating eosinophils
  - Altered cytokine expression
  - Sometimes mild-to-moderate increase in mast cell numbers

- Complexity beyond simple histamine release, with multiple inflammatory features

## Impact on Patient Quality of Life

The burden of chronic urticaria (CU) is substantial, affecting:

- Patient functioning and well-being
  - Comparable health status to patients with coronary artery disease
  - Lower health status than healthy subjects
  - Lower satisfaction compared to patients with respiratory allergies

- Comprehensive impact measured through:
  - Urticaria activity score (UAS)
  - Angioedema activity score (AAS)
  - CU quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL)
  - Urticaria control test (UCT)

- Significant costs for:
  - Patients
  - Healthcare system
  - Society

The multifaceted nature of urticaria underscores the need for comprehensive understanding and management of this complex condition.
