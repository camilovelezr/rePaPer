# Definition and Classification of Urticaria

## Definition of Urticaria

Urticaria is a medical condition characterized by the development of:

### Wheals (Hives)
A wheal has three typical features:
1. A sharply circumscribed superficial central swelling of variable size and shape, almost invariably surrounded by reflex erythema
2. An itching or sometimes burning sensation
3. A fleeting nature, with the skin returning to its normal appearance, usually within 30 min to 24 h

### Angioedema
Angioedema is characterized by:
1. A sudden, pronounced erythematous or skin-colored deep swelling in the lower dermis and subcutis or mucous membranes
2. Tingling, burning, tightness, and sometimes pain rather than itch
3. A resolution slower than that of wheals (can take up to 72 h)

## Classification of Urticaria

### Classification Based on Duration
- **Acute Urticaria**: Occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both for 6 weeks or less
- **Chronic Urticaria**: Occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks
  - Can be daily or almost daily
  - Can have an intermittent/recurrent course
  - May recur after months or years of full remission

### Classification Based on Triggers
1. **Spontaneous Urticaria**
   - No definite eliciting factor involved
   - Some patients may experience trigger-induced symptoms, but these are not consistent

2. **Inducible Urticaria**
   - Characterized by definite and subtype-specific triggers
   - Triggers always cause wheals, angioedema, or both when present
   - Specific triggers for each subtype (e.g., cold for cold urticaria)
   - Some rare subtypes require combined triggers

### Chronic Urticaria Subtypes
#### Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)
- Spontaneous appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both for >6 weeks
- Can be due to known or unknown causes

#### Inducible Urticaria
- Symptomatic dermographism
- Cold urticaria
- Delayed pressure urticaria
- Solar urticaria
- Heat urticaria
- Vibratory angioedema
- Cholinergic urticaria
- Contact urticaria
- Aquagenic urticaria

**Note**: Patients can have multiple subtypes of urticaria simultaneously.

## Important Distinctions
- Urticaria must be differentiated from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:
  - Anaphylaxis
  - Autoinflammatory syndromes
  - Urticarial vasculitis
  - Bradykinin-mediated angioedema

# Pathophysiology and Burden of Disease in Urticaria

## Mast Cell-Driven Mechanism

Urticaria is fundamentally a mast cell-driven disease characterized by:

- Release of multiple mediators from activated skin mast cells, including:
  - Histamine
  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF)
  - Cytokines

- Complex activation signals that are:
  - Heterogeneous and diverse
  - Include T cell-driven cytokines
  - Involve autoantibodies

- Histological characteristics of wheals:
  - Edema in upper and mid dermis
  - Dilated and increased permeability of postcapillary venules
  - Dilated lymphatic vessels of upper dermis

## Inflammatory Process

The inflammatory response in urticaria involves:

- Mixed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with:
  - T cells
  - Eosinophils
  - Basophils
  - Other inflammatory cells

- Nonlesional skin changes in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU):
  - Upregulation of adhesion molecules
  - Infiltrating eosinophils
  - Altered cytokine expression
  - Sometimes mild-to-moderate increase in mast cell numbers

- Complexity beyond simple histamine release, with multiple inflammatory features

## Impact on Patient Quality of Life

The burden of chronic urticaria (CU) is substantial, affecting:

- Patient functioning and well-being
  - Comparable health status to patients with coronary artery disease
  - Lower health status than healthy subjects
  - Lower satisfaction compared to patients with respiratory allergies

- Comprehensive impact measured through:
  - Urticaria activity score (UAS)
  - Angioedema activity score (AAS)
  - CU quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL)
  - Urticaria control test (UCT)

- Significant costs for:
  - Patients
  - Healthcare system
  - Society

The multifaceted nature of urticaria underscores the need for comprehensive understanding and management of this complex condition.

# Diagnostic Approach in Urticaria

## Clinical History and Examination

### Key Principles
- Detailed history taking is the first and most essential step in the diagnostic workup of all urticaria patients
- Physical examination is the second step
- Since wheals and angioedema are transient, it is crucial to:
  - Review patients' documentation of signs and symptoms
  - Examine patient-provided pictures of wheals and/or angioedema

## Diagnostic Workup for Acute Urticaria

### General Approach
- Usually does not require extensive diagnostic investigations
- Focus on identifying possible trigger factors
- Exception: Suspicion of acute urticaria due to:
  - Type I food allergy in sensitized patients
  - Drug hypersensitivity (especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)

### Recommended Actions
- Anamnesis for potential trigger factors
- If needed, conduct:
  - Allergy tests
  - Patient education about avoiding re-exposure to causative factors

## Diagnostic Workup for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)

### Comprehensive Diagnostic Aims
1. Confirm diagnosis
2. Exclude differential diagnoses
3. Identify underlying causes
4. Recognize conditions modifying disease activity
5. Check for comorbidities
6. Identify disease consequences
7. Assess predictors of disease course and treatment response
8. Monitor disease activity, impact, and control

### Diagnostic Process
1. **Thorough History**
2. **Physical Examination**
   - Including review of wheals/angioedema documentation
3. **Basic Tests**
   - Differential blood count
   - CRP and/or ESR
   - For specialized care:
     - Total IgE
     - IgG anti-TPO

### Extended Diagnostic Investigations
Based on initial findings, potential additional tests include:
- Infectious disease screening
- Functional autoantibody tests
- Thyroid function assessment
- Allergy testing
- Autoimmune disease evaluation
- Potential systemic disease investigations

### Key Considerations
- Avoid intensive, costly general screening programs
- Be aware of regional variations in underlying causes
- Individualize diagnostic approach

## Diagnostic Workup in Children

### Assessment Approach
- Similar to adult diagnostic framework
- Special attention to:
  - Detailed family history
  - Age of disease onset
  - Potential hereditary conditions
  - Age-appropriate provocation testing

## Diagnostic Tools and Instruments

### Disease Activity Assessment
- Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)
- Angioedema Activity Score (AAS)

### Quality of Life Measurement
- Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL)
- Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL)

### Disease Control Evaluation
- Urticaria Control Test (UCT)
- Angioedema Control Test (AECT)

## Recommendations for Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU)

### Diagnostic Goals
- Exclude differential diagnoses
- Identify specific subtype
- Determine trigger thresholds
- Assess disease activity and treatment response

### Specific Testing Methods
- Validated provocation tests for different subtypes
- Use of specialized devices (e.g., TempTestÂ®, Dermographometers)
- Threshold and control testing

The comprehensive approach emphasizes individualized, stepwise diagnostic evaluation, avoiding over-investigation while ensuring thorough assessment of urticaria's underlying mechanisms and impacts.

# Management and Treatment

## Treatment Goals

The primary goals of urticaria treatment are:
- Treat the disease until it is gone
- Treat as efficiently and safely as possible
- Aim for a continuous Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) of 0
- Achieve complete control
- Normalize quality of life

## Treatment Approach

The therapeutic approach to chronic urticaria should involve:
1. Search for and, if possible, elimination of underlying causes
2. Avoidance of eliciting factors
3. Tolerance induction
4. Pharmacological treatment to:
   - Prevent mast cell mediator release
   - Reduce effects of mast cell mediators

## Pharmacological Treatment Algorithm

### First-Line Treatment
- Second-generation H1-antihistamines (daily use)
- Standard dose 
- Preferred over first-generation antihistamines
- Examples include: cetirizine, desloratadine, levocetirizine

### Second-Line Treatment
- Updosing of H1-antihistamines (up to 4x standard dose)
- If inadequate control after 1-4 weeks

### Third-Line Treatment
- Omalizumab (add-on to H1-antihistamines)
- 300 mg every 4 weeks
- Can be increased to 600 mg every 2 weeks if insufficient response

### Fourth-Line Treatment
- Ciclosporin 
- 3.5-5 mg/kg per day
- Only for patients unresponsive to previous treatments

## Special Considerations

### Children
- Use same treatment algorithm with caution
- Weight-adjusted dosing
- Careful consideration of age and medication availability

### Pregnant and Lactating Women
- Avoid systemic treatments, especially in first trimester
- Prefer:
  - Loratadine
  - Possible extrapolation to desloratadine and cetirizine
- Omalizumab considered safe during pregnancy
- Individual risk-benefit assessment required

## Additional Treatment Recommendations

- Evaluate treatment necessity every 3-6 months
- Non-pharmacological interventions may help in some cases
- Avoid long-term corticosteroid use
- Short-term corticosteroids may be helpful in acute exacerbations

## Alternative Treatments

While evidence is low, some alternative treatments may be considered:
- Pseudoallergen-free diet
- Leukotriene receptor antagonists
- Immunosuppressives (in specific cases)
- Phototherapy
- Psychological interventions

## Key Principles

- Continuous treatment until symptoms resolve
- Personalized approach
- Regular reassessment
- Minimal side effects
- Improve patient quality of life
