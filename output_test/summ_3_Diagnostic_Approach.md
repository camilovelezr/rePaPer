# Diagnostic Approach in Urticaria

## Clinical History and Examination

### Key Principles
- Detailed history taking is the first and most essential step in the diagnostic workup of all urticaria patients
- Physical examination is the second step
- Since wheals and angioedema are transient, it is crucial to:
  - Review patients' documentation of signs and symptoms
  - Examine patient-provided pictures of wheals and/or angioedema

## Diagnostic Workup for Acute Urticaria

### General Approach
- Usually does not require extensive diagnostic investigations
- Focus on identifying possible trigger factors
- Exception: Suspicion of acute urticaria due to:
  - Type I food allergy in sensitized patients
  - Drug hypersensitivity (especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)

### Recommended Actions
- Anamnesis for potential trigger factors
- If needed, conduct:
  - Allergy tests
  - Patient education about avoiding re-exposure to causative factors

## Diagnostic Workup for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)

### Comprehensive Diagnostic Aims
1. Confirm diagnosis
2. Exclude differential diagnoses
3. Identify underlying causes
4. Recognize conditions modifying disease activity
5. Check for comorbidities
6. Identify disease consequences
7. Assess predictors of disease course and treatment response
8. Monitor disease activity, impact, and control

### Diagnostic Process
1. **Thorough History**
2. **Physical Examination**
   - Including review of wheals/angioedema documentation
3. **Basic Tests**
   - Differential blood count
   - CRP and/or ESR
   - For specialized care:
     - Total IgE
     - IgG anti-TPO

### Extended Diagnostic Investigations
Based on initial findings, potential additional tests include:
- Infectious disease screening
- Functional autoantibody tests
- Thyroid function assessment
- Allergy testing
- Autoimmune disease evaluation
- Potential systemic disease investigations

### Key Considerations
- Avoid intensive, costly general screening programs
- Be aware of regional variations in underlying causes
- Individualize diagnostic approach

## Diagnostic Workup in Children

### Assessment Approach
- Similar to adult diagnostic framework
- Special attention to:
  - Detailed family history
  - Age of disease onset
  - Potential hereditary conditions
  - Age-appropriate provocation testing

## Diagnostic Tools and Instruments

### Disease Activity Assessment
- Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)
- Angioedema Activity Score (AAS)

### Quality of Life Measurement
- Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL)
- Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL)

### Disease Control Evaluation
- Urticaria Control Test (UCT)
- Angioedema Control Test (AECT)

## Recommendations for Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU)

### Diagnostic Goals
- Exclude differential diagnoses
- Identify specific subtype
- Determine trigger thresholds
- Assess disease activity and treatment response

### Specific Testing Methods
- Validated provocation tests for different subtypes
- Use of specialized devices (e.g., TempTestÂ®, Dermographometers)
- Threshold and control testing

The comprehensive approach emphasizes individualized, stepwise diagnostic evaluation, avoiding over-investigation while ensuring thorough assessment of urticaria's underlying mechanisms and impacts.
